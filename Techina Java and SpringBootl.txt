1.What are the benefit of polymorphism.
-->Performing same in multiple form (teacher teaching many students)
Types Methodloading(compile time) and methodoverriden(Run time)
 Advantages:
 ->It helps programmers reuse the code,
 ->Reduce the tight coupling and helpes for perform loss coupling
 
 Disdavatages:
 -->Polymorphism reduces the readability of the code (MethodOverriden) 
 --> increse the tight coupling.
 
 Example: class Addition(){
 
  public int add(int a, int b){
  return a+b;
  }
  
  public float add(float a, float b){
  return a+b;
  }
 } 
 
2. Coupling
 ->Coupling is nothing but the dependency of one class on the other.
 2 types
 ->Loose coupling:When two classes, modules, or components have low dependencies on each other.(Independent on each other)
 example: class Volume {

   public static void main(String args[]) {

        Cylinder b = new Cylinder(25, 25, 25);

           System.out.println(b.getVolume());

   }

}

final class Cylinder {

    private int volume;

    Cylinder(int length, int width, int height) {

             this.volume = length * width * height;

    }

    public int getVolume() {

             return volume;

    }

}
->Tight Coupling:When two classes are highly dependent on each other

class Subject {
    Topic t = new Topic();
    public void startReading()
    {
        t.understand();
    }
}
class Topic {
    public void understand()
    {
        System.out.println("Tight coupling concept");
    }
}

3.What are the different way to initialize the object
-->Object is the real world entity
3 types:
**Using new keyword.

Tester tester1 = new Tester();
**Using Class.forName() method

Tester tester4 = (Tester)Class.forName("Tester").newInstance();
**Using clone method.

Tester tester2 = tester1.clone();

4.Basic data structure in the java (https://www.javatpoint.com/data-structure-tutorial)
Data Structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.

6. Write a program for the prime number , include the junit testing

public class Main 
{
	static boolean flag= false;
	
     public static void main(String args[]) 
     {
  	   System.out.println("Enter a number");
    	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in); 
    	int num=sc.nextInt();
    	for(int i=2;i<=num/2;i++) {  
    		if(num%i==0) {  
    			flag=true;
    			break;
    		}
    	}
    	if(flag==false) {
    		System.out.println(num +"is a prime number");
    	}
    	
    	else {
    		System.out.println(num +" not is a prime number");

    	}
     }
}

7. Spring Security SSL how we can achieve
->SSL – stands for Secure Sockets Layer, it is used for keep the data secure. It is the industry standard protocol for keeping an internet connection secure by safeguarding all sensitive data that is being sent between two systems, preventing hackers from reading and modifying any information transferred.

server.port=8443
server.ssl.key-alias=selfsigned_localhost_sslserver
server.ssl.key-password=changeit
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:ssl-server.jks
server.ssl.key-store-provider=SUN
server.ssl.key-store-type=JKS

8.What is API Gateway
-->An application programming interface (API) gateway is software that takes an application user’s request, routes it to one or more backend services
-->https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/api-gateway#:~:text=An%20application%20programming%20interface%20%28API%29%20gateway%20is%20software,threat%20protection%20and%20other%20security%20for%20the%20application.

9.Why String is immutable (https://www.javatpoint.com/immutable-string)
Once String object is created its data or state can't be changed but a new String object is created.
class Testimmutablestring{
 public static void main(String args[]){
   String s="Sachin";
   s.concat(" Tendulkar");//concat() method appends the string at the end
   System.out.println(s);//will print Sachin because strings are immutable objects
 }
}
Now it can be understood by the diagram given below. Here Sachin is not changed but a new object is created with Sachin Tendulkar. That is why String is known as immutable.
As you can see in the above figure that two objects are created but s reference variable still refers to "Sachin" not to "Sachin Tendulkar".

But if we explicitly assign it to the reference variable, it will refer to "Sachin Tendulkar" object.

13. Hibernate Mapping
One cart have many items --> One to many 
1.Bike manufacture can manufacture multiple models of the bike but the same bike model cannot be manufactured by multiple manufactures.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.geeksforgeeks.org/hibernate-one-to-many-mapping/amp/(One to many)
2.https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hibernate-many-to-one-mapping/ (Many employee work in one company)
3.one to one (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hibernate-one-to-one-mapping/) (one Employee has many address) (Jayant example)
14.Advantage of hibernate over jdbc.
-->Data base Dependency:The Hibernate is not dependent on the database whereas in the case of JDBC the queries that need to be written are dependent on the database.
